## Getting started

This is a hybrid framework for human body pose estimation using **MediaPipe**/**SynthPose MMPose** with external cameras, synchronized with **Meta Quest** tracking data for VR applications.

## Installation and run camera modules
 Python 3.10 is recommended

1. **Setup Mediapipe env:**

```
cd environments
.\setup-mediapipe.bat
.\run-mediapipe.bat
```

2. **Setup Synthpose env:**

```
cd environments
setup-synthpose.bat
run-synthpose.bat
```
